Yet Another React Starter Code

## Goals

The purpose of this project is to provide a highly configurable starter code without any abstractions for anyone who is looking build a webpage using react.

- [React] starter code for any one who wants build stuff
- Highly documented for anyone to understand
- NO hidden modules/abstractions. Everything is present in this repo for you to tweak.
- Coexistence of non conflicting components. Eg. [JavaScript] and [TypeScript]
- Configurability of conflicting components. Eg. [Style Lint] vs [Sass Lint]

## Approach

Keep it simple, any addition of capability will first be an [Issue on GitHub]. The [pull request] which solves the issue will be tagged and tracked for future references of how a particular feature was enabled.

[Style Lint]: https://stylelint.io/
[Sass Lint]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass-lint
[JavaScript]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript
[TypeScript]: https://www.typescriptlang.org/
[React]: https://reactjs.org/
[Issue on GitHub]: https://github.com/MadaraUchiha-314/yet-another-react-starter-code/issues
[pull request]: https://github.com/MadaraUchiha-314/yet-another-react-starter-code/pulls
